Yianna Paris is a Security Specialist, with a background in software development, digital design (think animation, 3D modelling), web hosting and running her own businesses. Her focus is breaking and building secure systems. Her strength has been software but she has always enjoyed diving deeper into hardware and devices. Her favourite programming language is C, for no other reason than it was the first language she was introduced to that was always called "terrible" - and she wanted to learn all the technicalities of why.

She's living in the Netherlands with her game dev husband and beautiful little one.
