tldr; I'm Yianna Paris and this site is a collection of my research, documentation and things I find interesting as it relates to security and programming. I have a Bachelor of Computer Science, Bachelor of Digital Media Design, I'm a conference speaker, trainer and consultant in the Offensive and Application Security side of things. I work mainly with web, and an increasing focus in embedded software and radio devices.
