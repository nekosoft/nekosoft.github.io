# Service and Software Enumeration for Modern Web Applications, IoT

- this might be split into two different sections. Not all IoT will include a web application or web communication. 
- can talk about specific protocols
- not sure if this is the right title with the relevant topics

## Protocols and Common Ports

Protocols are usually defined. There are some protocols where only a model is defined, and it's largely up to the developer to implement it that way unless there is widespread usage and a need for standardisation. Developers can still choose to implement something against the standard, which we will talk about more when covering topics such as REST, IoT  security frameworks, They can still change things or not adhere to the architecture or standards. Some are more widely adopted, where you'll see more maturity. This means that more people make an effort to make sure they adhere to and improve the standards, so that it can improve certain aspects (like security).


## Communication and API's

Different protocols communicate in various ways. They might have a structured way to send and receive data, or completely unstructured. It depends on the needs of the information being sent. We will go over several different protocols, API architecture patterns, database quirks and more. An important aspect is understanding how this communication happens and at what aspect we might be able to find certain data.

For example, in an Internet of Things (IoT) device, the Data Distribution Service (DDS) acts as a middleware protocol. It's usage is for real-time systems, think up-to-the-millisecond real-time, dependable and performant.
