This documentation will:

- take you through my reconnaissance methodology process
- use our programming skills to write our own programs
- test what can be automated, and continue to verify it's working
- learn about different radio frequencies and communication protocols commonly found in IoT
- probably a mix of information ranging from software defined radio to reverse engineering
