## About the project

This is the documentation site for https://nekosoft.github.io by Yianna Paris. This is a constantly evolving site that will include different research. As such, treat all information as work in progress, it might shift around.

Much of this work reflects my process and methodology. The main audience for this documentation is myself - to remind me of all the knowledge I acquire, where from, and how I can put it into practice. I am making it public bit by bit, hoping it might help someone else on their Offensive and Application Security journey. Everyone's background, experience and learning style is different so I tried to capture the essence of my style.
